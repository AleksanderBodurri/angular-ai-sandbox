My personal sandbox template for building reusable utility components with LLMs and Angular. This template is meant to give the LLM some structure to create the components so that they are easy to extract from the sandbox and use in other places.

### Usage
Simply load the application into https://aistudio.google.com/apps and then ask gemini to build whatever Angular component you like. The component will render in the sandbox in an isolated way that you can then iterate on. When you're done, find your new component in src/components/ui and export it to your own personal Angular Apps.
